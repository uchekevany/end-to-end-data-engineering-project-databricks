## **Data Sources**

* **Customer Data:** üë§ CSV files containing 500 million records from the CRM system.
* **Product Catalog:** üì¶ JSON files containing 0.5 million SKUs from the inventory management system.
* **Transaction History:** üõí Parquet files containing 10 billion transactions annually from the point-of-sale and e-commerce platforms.

## **Goals**

* **Reduce Data Processing Time:** ‚è∞ Accelerate data processing to improve time-to-insight.
* **Enhance Inventory Forecasting:** üìà Improve the accuracy of inventory forecasts to optimize stock levels.
* **Personalize Customer Experiences:** üéØ Deliver tailored recommendations and offers to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.
* **Enable Real-Time Reporting:** üìä Provide timely insights into financial performance and operational metrics.

## **Challenges**

* **Data Quality Issues:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent data formats, missing values, and data inaccuracies.
* **Data Format Diversity:** üîÄ Data is stored in various formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet) across different systems.
* **Complex ETL Processes:** ‚öôÔ∏è The integration of data from multiple sources requires complex ETL pipelines.

## **Solution**

We will implement a multi-layered data lakehouse architecture using Databricks with the following components:

* **Data Ingestion Layer (Bronze):** üì• Raw data landing zone for CSV, JSON, and Parquet files.
* **Data Processing Layer (Silver):** üîÑ Data cleaning, transformation, and standardization.
* **Data Consumption Layer (Gold):** üèÜ Unified customer view and analytical datasets.
* **Reporting & Dashboarding Layer:** üìä Power BI integration for interactive visualizations and reports.
